The 7447 IC is a BCD-to-Seven-Segment latch/decoder/driver integrated circuit. It is widely used in digital display applications to convert Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) input into the corresponding 7-segment display outputs. The primary purpose of the 7447 IC is to simplify the interfacing of numeric displays in electronic circuits, allowing for efficient and straightforward representation of numerical information.

            COMPONENTS
To use the 7447 IC, you typically need the following components:

1. **7447 IC:** The main IC responsible for converting BCD input to 7-segment display outputs.
  
2. **Seven-Segment Display:** The display unit that visually represents the output. Common anode or common cathode displays can be used depending on the specific 7447 IC variant.

3. **BCD Input Source:** A BCD input source, such as switches or a microcontroller, providing the binary-coded decimal input to the 7447 IC.

4. **Power Supply:** A suitable power supply to provide the required voltage and current for the 7447 IC and the connected display.

5. **Current-Limiting Resistors:** Resistors to limit the current flowing through the 7-segment display LEDs, ensuring proper operation and preventing damage.

            CONNECTIONS
   When interfacing the 7447 IC with an Arduino UNO, the connections involve:

1. **BCD Inputs (A, B, C, D):** Connect these to the digital output pins on the Arduino UNO that provide the BCD input. Ensure that the pins are set to OUTPUT mode.

2. **LE (Latch Enable):** Connect to a digital output pin on the Arduino UNO. This pin is active low, so set it to LOW for the data to be latched.

3. **BI (Blanking Input):** Connect to a digital output pin on the Arduino UNO. Set this pin to HIGH to disable the lamp test.

4. **a, b, c, d, e, f, g:** Connect these to the corresponding segments of the seven-segment display. Use current-limiting resistors to protect the LEDs.

5. **Vcc (Power Supply):** Connect to the 5V output pin on the Arduino UNO.

6. **GND (Ground):** Connect to the ground (GND) pin on the Arduino UNO

### What is 7447 ??
The 7447 is a BCD-to-Seven-Segment Decoder/Driver integrated circuit (IC). BCD stands for Binary-Coded Decimal, which is a way of representing decimal numbers using four binary bits. The 7447 IC takes a BCD input and converts it into the 7-segment display format.
### Key features of the 7447 IC include::
<pre>
  <b>1)BCD Input:</b> It accepts a 4-bit Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) input, representing decimal digits 0 through 9.

  <b>2)7-Segment Output:</b>The 7447 converts the BCD input into the corresponding signals for a 7-segment display. A 7-segment display is a visual representation of numbers using seven individual segments, labeled A through G, arranged in the shape of the number "8."

  <b>3)Decimal Point Output:</b> Some versions of the 7447 also include a decimal point output for displaying decimal numbers.

  <b>4)Latch and Lamp Test Inputs: </b>The 7447 may have additional inputs for latching the current input and for testing the display lamps.

### But Why 7447 ? When we can directly display numbers using arduino 
Yes displaying numbers on 7 segment display is also possible directly without any intervention of 7447, but the process here is lengthy and we need to provide it with the binary number format, which is quite hectic. 
### So.. To Solve this:
We use 7447 Decoder in order to take digital numbers as input and generate a format that is then sent to 7-segment display in order to simplify our work.<br>
i.e we use arduino to send info to 7447 which in turn converts it and sends to 7-segment display.
