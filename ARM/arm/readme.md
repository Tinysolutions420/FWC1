1. **Definition of FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array):**
   FPGA stands for Field-Programmable Gate Array. It is a type of programmable logic device that can be configured by a user or a designer after manufacturing. Unlike traditional integrated circuits, which are fixed in their functionality, FPGAs allow users to program and reprogram the logic circuits and interconnections to suit their specific application requirements.

2. **Core Working of FPGA:**
   FPGAs consist of an array of programmable logic blocks and programmable interconnects. The logic blocks typically contain look-up tables (LUTs), flip-flops, and other elements. The interconnects allow these logic blocks to be connected and configured based on the desired logic functions. The programming is done using hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog or VHDL. This flexibility makes FPGAs suitable for a wide range of applications.

3. **Physical Connections to be Given:**
   FPGAs require connections to power supplies, configuration interfaces (to load the user-defined configuration), and external devices or circuits. Common connections include power pins (VCC and GND), configuration pins (to load the bitstream), clock inputs, and I/O pins for interfacing with external components.

4. **Applications of FPGA:**
   - **Digital Signal Processing (DSP):** FPGAs are often used in applications requiring high-speed signal processing, such as audio and video processing.
   - **Communication Systems:** FPGAs are employed in communication devices and networks for tasks like protocol implementation, encryption, and signal modulation.
